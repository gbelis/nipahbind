# nipahbind
Work in Adaptyv Bio’s protein design competition, where I am developing a pipeline to target the Nipah virus protein G. To competitively bind the disordered interaction area with the ephrin receptor, I implemented a workflow using BioEmu to sample conformational ensembles of the disordered regions. These ensembles were then used to condition BoltzGen for precise binder design.
